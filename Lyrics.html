    <p> I don't want a lot for Christmas <br>
        There is just one thing I need <br>
        I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree <br>
        I just want you for my own <br>
        More than you could ever know <br>
        Make my wish come true <br>
        All I want for Christmas is you <br>
        Yeah <br> <br> 
        I don't want a lot for Christmas <br>
        There is just one thing I need (and I)<br>
        Don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree<br>
        I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace<br>
        Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day<br>
    </p>
